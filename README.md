Hi, my name is Greg O'Connell (He/Him) and welcome to my github. 

I'm using this to showcase some of the projects I've done in my graduate program in Applied Political Analytics, as well as any personal projects.

My main language is R, but some projects have python in them as well.

If you would like to reach out please email me at greg.oconnell.work@gmail.com

Thanks!
